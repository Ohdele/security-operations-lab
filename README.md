# Enterprise Security Operations & Threat Response Lab

## Project Definition
Build and operate an enterprise-grade SOC environment using SIEM, EDR, SOAR, and cloud tools to simulate real-time monitoring, threat hunting, and incident response.

## Goals
- Detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents across endpoints, network, and cloud.
- Develop SIEM dashboards, EDR alerts, SOAR playbooks, threat hunting queries, and incident reports.
- Document all lab activities and outputs in proof logs.
