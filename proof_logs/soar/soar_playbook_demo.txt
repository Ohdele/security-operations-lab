Playbook Demo 1 : Failed SSH Brute Force Response

Trigger:
Multiple failed SSH authentication events from same source IP.

Automated Actions:
1. Enrich source IP with geo and reputation lookup.
2. Add source IP to temporary firewall block list.
3. Disable targeted user account if threshold exceeded.
4. Notify SOC via email or Slack with incident summary.

Outcome:
Attack source contained automatically and SOC notified for review.


Playbook Demo 2: Executed SSH Brute Force Auto‑Block

Trigger:
Repeated failed SSH authentication events detected in auth.log.

Command Executed:
sudo ~/projects/security-operations-lab/proof_logs/soar/auto_block_ssh_ip.sh

Automated Action Performed:
Source IPs exceeding the failure threshold were automatically blocked using iptables.

Verification:
sudo iptables -L -n | grep DROP

Result:
Live firewall rules applied successfully, confirming automated containment without manual intervention.
